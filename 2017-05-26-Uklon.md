Microsoft team had a discussion with Uklon about the opportunities for implementation of new CaaP and CS based services focused on improvement of existing company’s software solution aimed to help users order taxi. Outcomes of the project may positively effect on the Uklon services market presence and arrange larger audience by increasing the number of channels for interaction with service and thus, enhancing simplicity and effectiveness of taxi services distribution over the different user groups. Microsoft also has a great advantage to implement new tools and services over the Ukrainian market in purely unique niche. Microsoft and Uklon agreed to develop a POC version for Phase One, which will include CaaP services integration with Skype and Facebook IMP’s. After Phase One is successfully implemented, Uklon also plans to integrate additional IMP’s, such as Viber, the top second platform over Ukraine, VK and others. Also, it is possibility to enhance solution by adding Cognitive Services LUIS AI for data processing and automation.


## Customer profile ##
Uklon | https://uklon.com.ua/

Uklon is online transportation network company which was founded same year as Uber (2009). Despite tight competition from Uber, Yandex,
Red, Tap Taxi services Uklon (uklon.com.ua) is significantly bigger in terms of number of trips provided and with widest geography. Previous year company extend their present, while launching service in Georgia.
Uklon chose Microsoft as it provides a great set of cross-platform CaaP services based on Azure technologies that may be used for integration with multiple API’s and ensures solution stability, consistency, and efficiency.
Moreover, architecture is capable of expansion via integration with additional technologies for improvement in collaboration effectiveness with consumers (especially, with such instant messaging platforms (IMP’s) as Skype and Facebook for Phase One, and Viber, Telegram, VK and others for Subsequent Phases). Besides that, solution may be easily powered with Cognitive Services for data processing, like LUIS AI.
Company location: Kyiv, Ukraine.


## Problem statement ##
Currently, to order taxi with Uklon (Uber or any other) user forced to download app from store, create account, add payment method and many other steps that are not directly related to the trip. In eyes of consumer basic needs is much simpler. User just need a car in the place he wants as fast as possible.
Also, users are unable to get access to app or web version in case if internet connection is limited by Ukrainian telecom provider because of reaching a limit on their prepaid mobile accounts. It usually also leads to inability for making a phone call too.
Even more, there is always a target audience passionate about new technologies on the market who are focused on using innovative solutions and so, often attracted by competitors who provide unique additional services and app features.


## Solution and steps ##
Bot solves the user’s needs in the quickest and easiest way compared to application.
As far as cash is main scenario to pay for taxi service in Ukraine, there is no need to add payment data or create account accordingly. Only required data from user is phone number, so driver can call user beck. In case if bot was used once (so platform store users phone number) calling taxi looks as simple as launch preferred messaging platform and provide it with pickup address. That's it! Moreover, chat bots may help to avoid a huge stopper for users to order a taxi, such as inability to order via phone, app or website because of absence of money on mobile accounts, as vast majority of Ukrainian telecom providers include an unlimited free access to instant messaging platforms, such as Skype, Facebook, VK, Viber etc. Company had internal discussion on bot launch previous year, however support of several platforms force them to postpone development. A bit later competition moved it to the next stage - libre taxi (http://libretaxi.org/) is first international "OSS" taxi, which launched recently and it's available via Telegram bot platform only (no www or apps). Outcome 1. Uklon is aggressive in marketing, so we can expect promotion, including ATL advertising. 2.In terms of visibility in tech audience, keys are outstanding, as far as Uklon one of the most visible local consumer ISV (Ukraine + Georgia) which compete with international giants. 3. As of now Uklon bought on-prem infrastructure to support their current workloads. CaaP is good entry point to seed Azure PaaS and SaaS solutions for upcoming services. As far as audience of taxi is wide, Uklon is in need to support number of different platforms to fully cover the target audience and simplify the interaction process to avoid any obstacles between system and user that can possibly arise. It may tend to increase in total number of regular users. Thanks to chat bot platform they can make it in a single unified way, without supporting multiple platforms.


## Technical delivery ##
The Bot is written using MS Bot Framework SDK, works with two cognitive services: LUIS and MS Translator Text API, has multi language support. Thanks to LUIS and MS Translator Text API, he understands users intents and utterances. With MS Bot Framework SDK, bot can be easily integrated to all popular messages (Skype, Telegram, Slack etc.) he also integrated with Viber that's unsupported out of the box.

He has persisted user state, he implements a possibility to order a taxi. Bot manages conversation flow using waterfall dialogs handler, the bot prompts the user for input, waits for a response, and then passes the result to the next step. After this the bot creates a child dialog to advance the conversation to the next step.

The entry point of the bot is the controller that receives Activity object. Activity used for passing information back and forth between bot and channel (user). It contains user message text and unique user ID. The controller send Activity to the root dialog.

Since LUIS fully supports only English language, we use MS Translator Text API to translate user messages, from local language to English. Root dialog passes the received message to the translator, and then sends it to LUIS. LUIS processed the message and returns user intent, depending on the intent bot will redirect context to other child dialogs eventually returning back to the root dialog at the end of the conversation. When bot replies to user, message text converts back to user local language.

The Bot knows how to authenticate user in the Uklon system.
When the user starts a conversation for the first time, bot asks his or her phone number and city of residence and associates this user info with his or her Viber id. The Azure SQL Server database holds all the data.
Since then, user can order a cab- he or she enters pickup and destination addresses, sends it to bot, and he forms an order in the Uklon system. The user is notified, when the driver is found. Also, user can change order details and offer additional fee to find a driver faster.
To make communication easier for user, bot uses built-in keyboards.

Entry Controller:

```cs
public async Task<HttpResponseMessage> Post([FromBody]Activity activity){

    ...
        await Conversation.SendAsync(activity, () => new RootDialog()); 
    ...
    
}
```

Root Dialog creates correct dialog depending on LUIS intent:
```cs

private async Task HandleUserInput(IDialogContext context, Activity activity)
{
 ...
   _userLocalLang = await _translatorHelper.GetLanguageType(activity.Text);
   var englishText = await _translatorHelper.GetTranslatedText(activity.Text, LangType.en);
   var luisAnswer = await _luisHelper.GetResult(englishText);
                
       switch (luisAnswer.TopScoringIntent.Intent)
        {
          case "Change Car":
              context.Call(_dialogStrategy.CreateDialog(DialogFactoryType.Root.ChangeCar, _userLocalLang)
          break;
          case "Additional Person":
              context.Call(_dialogStrategy.CreateDialog(DialogFactoryType.Root.AdditionalPerson, _userLocalLang), ResumeAfterDialog);
          break;
          case "Animals Transport":
             context.Call(_dialogStrategy.CreateDialog(DialogFactoryType.Root.AnimalsTransportation, _userLocalLang),ResumeAfterDialog);
          break;
          case "Email Subscription":
             context.Call(_dialogStrategy.CreateDialog(DialogFactoryType.Root.EmailSubscription, _userLocalLang), ResumeAfterDialog);
          break;
          default:
             await context.PostAsync(await _translatorHelper.GetTranslatedText("Sorry. I didn't understand.", _userLocalLang));
             context.Wait(MessageReceivedAsync);
          break;
        }
        ...
        
```

Child Dialog conversation flow:
```cs
private async Task MessageReceivedAsync(IDialogContext context, IAwaitable<object> result){

var message = await result as Activity;
var englishText = await _translatorHelper.GetTranslatedText(message?.Text, LangType.en);
var luisAnswer = await _luisHelper.GetResult(englishText);

switch (luisAnswer.TopScoringIntent.Intent)
{
  case "Animals Transport":
   context.Call(_dialogStrategy.CreateDialog(DialogFactoryType.Animal.AnimalWeight, _userLocalLang), ResumeAfterAnimalWeightDialog);
  return;

   default:
     await context.PostAsync(await _translatorHelper.GetTranslatedText("Yes You can do this", _userLocalLang));
     context.Done(message);
     return;
 }
}

private async Task ResumeAfterAnimalWeightDialog(IDialogContext context, IAwaitable<object> result)
{
  if (await result is Activity)
     context.Call(_dialogStrategy.CreateDialog(DialogFactoryType.Animal.PlacementForAnimal, _userLocalLang), ResumeAfterPlacementForAnimalDialog);
  else
      context.Done((Activity) null);
 }

private async Task ResumeAfterPlacementForAnimalDialog(IDialogContext context, IAwaitable<object> result)
{
  if (await result is Activity)
       context.Call(_dialogStrategy.CreateDialog(DialogFactoryType.Animal.Destination, _userLocalLang), EndDialog);
   else
       context.Done((Activity) null);
 }


private static async Task EndDialog(IDialogContext context, IAwaitable<object> result)
  {
   var message = await result as Activity;
   context.Done(message);
   }
   
```

LUIS Helper:
```cs
public async Task<Luis> GetResult(string query)
        {
            using (var httpClient = new HttpClient())
            {
                var req = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["LuisEndpoint"] + HttpUtility.UrlEncode(query);
                var response = await httpClient.GetAsync(req);

                if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
                {
                    var jsonResponse = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
                    return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Luis>(jsonResponse);
                }
                return null;
            }
```

Text translator using MS Translator Text API:
```cs
public async Task<string> GetTranslatedText(string text, LangType language)
{
 using (var httpClient = new HttpClient())
  {

        var req = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["TranslateTextEndpoint"].ConnectionString +
                HttpUtility.UrlEncode(text) + "&to=" + language;

                httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", await                                                  TranslatorAuthToken.GetAccessTokenAsync());

                var response = await httpClient.GetAsync(req);

                if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
                {
                    var resultStream = await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync();
                    var translatedStream = new StreamReader(resultStream, Encoding.GetEncoding("utf-8"));
                    var result = new XmlDocument();

                    result.LoadXml(translatedStream.ReadToEnd());
                    return result.InnerText;
                }
                return null;
            }
        }
```

Setting a Viber Webhook:
Resource URL: https://chatapi.viber.com/pa/set_webhook

Post data:
```json
        {
            "url": "https://my.host.com/api/viber/post",  
            "event_types": ["message"] 
            
        }
```
X-Viber-Auth-Token need to be passed in http headers. This request gives an access to all the "message" events.

Note: in 'url' parameter https is required!

If everything is ok, the response should be:
```json
        {
            "status": 0,  
            "status_message": "ok",  
            "event_types": ["message"] 
        }
```

When the Webhook is set, it is possible to recieve messages in appropriate controller action:

```cs
    public class ViberController : ApiController
    {
        public HttpResponseMessage Post([FromBody] ViberCallbackModel callback)
        {
            // Handle message here.
        }
    }
```

Viber callback fully describes incoming message. It has the following structure:

```cs
    public class ViberCallbackModel
    {
        [JsonProperty("event")]
        public string CallbackEvent { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty("timestamp")]
        public long? Timestamp { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty("message_token")]
        public long? MessageToken { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty("user_id")]
        public string UserId { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty("desc")]
        public string Desc { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty("type")]
        public string Type { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty("context")]
        public string Context { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty("user")]
        public User User { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty("sender")]
        public Sender Sender { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty("message")]
        public Message Message { get; set; }
    }
```
When the bot recieves the message, the first task is to determine the state of current user's dialog. The bot application defines the following states for each dialog:

```cs
    public enum DialogStates
    {
        Authorization,
        ProvidePhoneNumber,
        ProvidePhoneConfirmationCode,
        ProvideCity,
        ProvideUserInputPickupStreet,
        ProvideKeyboadrPickupStreet,
        ProvidePickupHouseNumber,
        ProvideUserInputDestinationStreet,
        ProvideKeyboadrDestinationStreet,
        ProvideDestinationHouseNumber,
        ReviewOrder,
        EditOrder,
        WaitingForInfo,
        WaitingForCar,
        Running,
        Completed,
        Canceled
    }
```

The bot stores all the dialogs states in association with user ids. 

The following method is used to send answers in Viber dialog:

```cs
        public void SendResponse(string recieverViberId, string responseText, Keyboard keyboard)
        {
            try
            {
                ViberMessageModel sendResponse = new ViberMessageModel
                {
                    Receiver = recieverViberId,
                    Text = responseText,
                    Type = "text"
                };
                if (keyboard != null)
                    sendResponse.Keyboard = keyboard;

                string jsonBody = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(sendResponse);

                using (var client = new HttpClient())
                {
                    var request = new HttpRequestMessage
                    {
                        RequestUri = new Uri("https://chatapi.viber.com/pa/send_message"),
                        Method = HttpMethod.Post
                    };
                    request.Headers.Add("X-Viber-Auth-Token", WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ViberAuthToken"]);
                    request.Content = new StringContent(jsonBody, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");
                    var task = client.SendAsync(request)
                        .ContinueWith(async taskwithmsg =>
                        {
                            var innerResponse = await taskwithmsg;
                            await innerResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
                        });
                    task.Wait();
                }
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                Trace.TraceError(e.Message);
                throw;
            }
        }
```

## Conclusion ##
Online taxi ordering is still one of the hottest topics with potential growth in other cloud direction like IoT and Big data. Currently all service hosts on premise, This project would allow customer to try PaaS and SaaS solutions on Windows Azure and take it in consideration with father investments.
We will use CaaP to write one branch of code for multiple platforms. However, features for different messengers may vary, especially when we talk about kind of “advanced” features for bots today, like geo location. However, idea here is stay as simple as possible for consumer, and maps integration can be skipped for now, as other tricky features.
